Through interactive workshops, group discussions, and one-on-one sessions, participants learned about the importance of education, life skills, and setting goals for the future..</p></li>
        
        <p><strong><h3>Mercy Paula Charity Event (April 2023)</h3></strong><br><li>Our team and volunteers spent a heartwarming day cooking meals and sharing joy with children from marginalized communities. We organized fun activities, played games, and created a lively atmosphere filled with laughter and learning. Alongside the fun, we hosted a brief mentorship session where we discussed the importance of education, self-belief, and setting goals. The event not only provided a nutritious meal but also created lasting memories for the kids and helped them feel supported during a challenging time </p></li>

        <p><strong><h3>Annual Watoto Festival (December 2023)</h3></strong><Last><br><li>Last year, we hosted the inaugural Watoto Festival, a joyful celebration dedicated to children from marginalized communities. The festival was filled with fun activities, games, performances, and interactive workshops, creating an unforgettable experience for the kids. This event also provided an opportunity for the children to express their talents and creativity while learning valuable life skills. Due to the incredible success and positive impact, we are excited to announce that the Watoto Festival will now be an annual tradition, continuing to bring joy, learning, and hope to these young minds.</p></li>
